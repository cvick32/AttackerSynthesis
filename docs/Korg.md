# What is Korg?

Korg is a tool for *attacker synthesis*.  Specifically, given:

* a system model `P`, called the "target process";
* a model `Q` called the "vulnerable process"
  * with interface `IO`;
* and a property `phi`,
  * where `P || Q |= phi`,

Korg will try to generate a new process `A` called an attacker that has the interface `IO` and violates `phi` when composed with `P`.

Intuitively, Korg assumes the adversary can "hack" a process `Q` in an environment `P`, and attempts to prove that in so doing, an adversary might induce `P` to violate `phi`.

# How can I install Korg?

See the [install docs](Install.md).

# How can I use Korg?

See the [usage docs](Usage.md).

## ... using the Makefile

Read the `#comments` in the [Makefile](../Makefile).  *TL;DR:*

* To run `experiment1` without recovery, do `make experiment1`.
* To run `experiment2` or `experiment3`, change `--phi=experiments/experiment1.pml` to `--phi=experiments/experiment2.pml` or `--phi=experiments/experiment3.pml` in the `experiment1` target.  Then do `make experiment1`.
* To run `experiment1` with recovery, change `--with_recovery=False` to `--with_recovery=True` in the `experiment1` target, then do `make experiment1`.
* To reproduce our results, do `make avgExperiment`.
* To run unit tests for main body of `Korg` logic, do `make testKorg`.
* To run unit tests for `Characterize.py`, do `make testChar`.
* To run unit tests for `Construct.py`, do `make testCons`.
* To run all the unit tests, do `make test`.
* To clean up after running one of the targets, do `make clean`.

## ... using Bash

See the [Usage docs](Usage.md), or, adapt the commands in the Makefile to your needs.

## ... using Windows

Use `Cygwin`, or, remove your operating system, and replace it with a [better one](https://www.linuxmint.com/), or, use a [virtual machine](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

* Jokes aside, I have not tried this on `Cygwin`.  If you are brave enough to do so, please let me know if you run into any issues, and I'm happy to try and debug them!  The [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/maxvonhippel/AttackerSynthesis/issues) is a good place to do this.

## I ran Korg on my threat model.  Now, how do I interpret the results?

See [interpreting outputs](InterpretingOutputs.md).

## Help!  It's not working!
